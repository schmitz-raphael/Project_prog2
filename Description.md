# Narrative

(Â© Eiichiro Oda, Shueisha Comics)

Wealth, fame, power. The world had it all won by one man: the Pirate King, Gold Roger. At his death, the words he spoke drove countless men out to sea.
My treasure? It's yours if you want it. Find it! I left all the world has there!
And so men set sights on the Grand Line, in pursuit of their dreams. The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

2 decades after his death, the Straw hat pirates set sail in pursuit of this famous treasure. However they have yet to arrive on the secret island called Laugh Tale, which to this day no person other than Gold Roger has reached. 

In order to reach the final island, the Straw hats need to collect the 4 Road-porneglyphes, which store the information of its location. 

Currently 2 of these are in possession of Big Mom and Kaido 2 of the 4 emperors of the sea, which are very powerful pirates, which occupy a large territory in the Grand line. 

The other are 2 hidden on Zou and Elbaf, where the Straw Hats need to solve a mystery in order to reach these.

# Characters
For the game, there will be 3 playable characters:

- Monkey D. Luffy, the captain of the Straw hat pirates who's a very good eater. While he's still unaware of it, the powers of an ancient god slumber in him, which can only be awoken in combat.

- Roronoa Zorro, a swordsman that practices the 3 sword style, but with a very bad sense of direction.
- Vinsmoke Sanji, the cook of the ship who because of his chivalry is unable to hurt women.

# Rooms & exits

## Rooms
For the game, the rooms are the different islands that are on the Grand line.

The map looks as following:

    ->Fishman Island ------> Dressrosa <------> Zou <-----------------> Land of wano
            |                                   |                          |
            |                                   |                          |
            |                                   |                          |
        Laugh Tale                     Whole cake island <---------->   Elbaf  ----> Fishman Island

## Exits
As already seen in the map, every room is accessible from both ways, except for Fishman Island, which due to it being located below sea level is only accessible coming from the first half of the Grand-line which is not included in the game. However you can still access it by going around the globe and accessing it from the first half, with the last island here being Elbaf.
