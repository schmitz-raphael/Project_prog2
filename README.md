This console based game was done as a group project in the Programming 2 class at the University of Luxembourg along with one other person. This repository was pulled from the Github Classroom repository.
# Programming 2 (2023): Interactive Fiction - Template

Build your game on top of the provided framework `Sources/prog2-2023-project/InteractiveFictionFramework`.
- Do not modify the files contained in that folder!
- You can find an example project using that framework in the lab solutions repo.

## Possible issue when building

Double-check the .vscode/launch.json file:
- Wherever you see the line `workspaceFolder:prog2-2023-project-template`, adjust it to your group's repo name.
- Normally VSC adjusts this automatically, but if it hasn't then perform this change yourself.

# Build instructions 

No third-party APIs have been used.

# Changes to the initial project description

## Characters 

The characters have undergone some modifications, wherein some of their individual traits have been removed. Instead, they have been given individual battle moves and possibly items that can enhance their powers.

- Monkey D. Luffy, the captain of the Straw hat pirates, is no longer a good eater. However, while he's still unaware of it, he has hidden powers in him, which can only be awoken in combat.

- Roronoa Zorro, a swordsman that practices the 3-sword style. He is known for his bad sense of direction. Rumors say that he is one of the selected few who can successfully wield one of the legendary swords.

- Vinsmoke Sanji, the cook aboard the ship, has always been known for his chivalry and code of honor that prevents him from hurting women. However, things have changed. We removed his chivalry, but instead Sanji has been given a powerful item, which grants him enhanced abilities and enables him to overcome his previous limitations.

##  Collectible Items

A few adjustments have been made to the collectible items:

- Road Poneglyphs --> In order to reach Laugh Tale, a pirate must be in possession of the four Road Poneglyphs, which function as a key to the final island.

- Food --> which can either be bought from shops on an island or cooked. If you want to cook, choose your character wisely.

- Enma --> A legendary sword which Zoro can obtain in the Land of Wano in order to learn new attacks.

- Raid Suit --> A work of science that allows Sanji to learn new attacks.

## Minigames

Apart from the two mini-games that are already known,

- Rock-paper-scissors 
- Tic-tac-toe

We have decided to introduce a new one to the list. This game has been designed with the goal of allowing players to make a lot of money. Fast!

- Blackjack

## Battles

There will be 2 battles against Kaido and Big-Mom, which need to be defeated in order to obtain their road-Poneglyphes.

The battles will work in a turn-based combat like in normal Role-Playing Games.

Each character and enemy will have a set of attacks, which will deal a set amount of damage, while NO LONGER draining stamina.

Every playable character has their own way to learn new Attacks.

Zorro and Sanji will awaken once they find a certain item on the map.

Meanwhile, Luffy has to reach his limits during combat in order to awaken his hidden powers.

## Interactions 

Our interactions have probably gotten the biggest change.

Here are the now usable commands:

- "help" in order to print all usable commands to the player

- "move" in order to sail from island to the next one

- "stop" in order to stop the game entirely

- "solve" in order to solve the mini-game if there is a mini-game on the island

- "play" in order to play the money mini-game if there is a money mini-game on the island

- "fight" in order to battle it out if there is a battle on the island

- "cook"
    Sanji can add food to his own inventory.
    Nothing happens when Zorro uses it as he's unable to find the kitchen.
    Luffy will die because he's unaware of his bad cooking skills and poisons himself.

- "rest" in order to refill the health bar of the playable character

- "inventory" in order to print all the items in the inventory

- "map" in order to print the map (only works if the Log-Port is in the inventory).

- "buy" in order to buy items at a shop, if there is one on the island.

## Points System

- Health: used in combats, can be restored upon eating food.

- Stamina Points (SP) --> used in combats in order to perform attacks (Has been Removed)

- Berry: monetary system which allows the player to buy food or items from shops.


# Bonus Features

We have implemented multiple bonus features:

- We have implemented so-called "Shops," which are located on Fishman Island, the Land of Wano, and Whole Cake Island. They allow the player to trade their currency for items. Items that can be bought from shops include:
    - different kinds of Food
    - Log Port (our map)
    - Enma
    - Raid Suit, ...

- All three of our characters have their own way to evolve:
    - Zoro can evolve by upgrading his sword
    - Sanji can evolve by obtaining the Raid Suit
    - Luffy can evolve by reaching his limits in combats

- All three of our characters have the ability to cook, but:
    - If Luffy cooks, there's a special interaction
    - If Zoro tries to cook, he will have trouble finding the kitchen.
    - If Sanji tries to cook, he will successfully add food to your inventory.

- Three endings have been added to the game:
    - goodEnding(), if you manage to find all four Road-Poneglyphs.
    - badEnding(), if you die in combat.
    - secretEnding(), as in the name it's secret (Let Luffy cook).

# Special Swift language features

We used "\u{001B}[31m" and ".\u{001B}[0m" to make the text turn red 
(only used in the Shop.swift)

# Bugs and Issues

# Automated Game Mode

Considering that our room layout is mostly linear, the player decides the direction he goes into by going in a random direction and checking if he's already been on that island. This is done over a cache, we called "roomCache". We only needed to exclude Elbaf out of that list, because it's a cross point. So after Zou, the player either goes to Land Of Wano/ Whole-Cake-Island, then Elbaf in both cases, to only go to the only island left and go back to Elbaf. At this point the player has all 4 porneglyphs, so while unlocking Laugh Tale, Fishman Island becomes available again, so the player can go there.

Battles and all minigames (except BlackJack, cause it's not a necessity) have been changed to play them automatically. 

While in auto mode, the player also claims all items of a shop, without having to buy them. 

# Full console output

Wealth, fame, power. The world had it all won by one man: the Pirate King, Gold Roger.
